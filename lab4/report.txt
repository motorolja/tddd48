1. Compare building the HTN domain to what you did previously in PDDL.
Was it easier/harder?
Using HTN was a lot harder to do, since it required the writer to
think about all possible actions and conditions that have to be
fulfilled for each task that should be solvable.

2. Is the JHOP2 faster/slower than the competition planners from previous
labs?

Much faster. (see explanation of why below)

3. How does JSHOP2 run-times scale with larger problems?

It scales very well. This is because we have provided the algorithm
with all possible states and actions it can take. The result of this
approach is that each state does not branch out anything, leaving a
very thin and deep search tree which is optimized only as good as the
writers skill.
