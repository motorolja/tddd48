TDDD48 - Lab6 Report

Questions:

In the report, write which planners you have chosen and describe how they work
in general terms. Also report your findings when it comes to plan quality, 
generated states and time used by the planner. Select at least 3 different
planners that you run on the same problems.

Domains:
1. Maze_planar, Robot = default
2. pipedream_ring, Robot = default

Planners:
1. TRRT

Pipedream:
Times(s) - 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.6, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9
Generated states per second - ~2800
Solutions - All have been pretty much the same and a solution was always found.

Maze:
Times(s) - 0.21, 0.24, 0.24, 0.33, 0.39, 0.44, 0.48,
           0.52, 0.55, 0.56, 0.68, 0.72, 0.72, 0.74 
Generated states per second - ~2500
Solutions - All have been pretty much the same and a solution was always found.
Finds the optimal solution most of the time. The suboptimal solutions were
always relatively low-cost.

2. SPARS2

Pipedream:
Times(s) - 7, 16, 16, 17, 19, 24, 25, 27, 28, 44
Generated states - ~140
Solutions - All have been pretty much the same and a solution was always found.

Maze:
Times(s) - 0.7, 0.8, 1.1, 1.2, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, 3.0,  
Generated states - 70 
Solutions - The suboptimal solutions found ranged from low to high cost. Most
solutions found were suboptimal, whereas only a few had close to optimal cost. A
solution was always found.

3.STRIDE

Pipedream:
Times(s) - 1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 10, 11
Generated states per second - ~600
Solutions - All are more or less the same and a solution was always found.
Generated solutions are less wobbly than for other algorithms, due to more
states around the chosen path which makes interpolation of states much smoother.


Maze:
Times(s) - 0.3, 0.3, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.8, 1.3, 
           1.7, 1.8, 2.2, 2.2, 3.4, 3.8, 4.3, 
           7.3, 8.2, 9.3, 9.3
Generated states per second - 1000-1800
Solutions - The solutions that were found fast did not explore areas in the
"wrong" direction that much, instead they quickly found the correct path by
accident. The searches that took longer time explored a lot of uneccesary areas.



Summary - Pipedream

STRIDE and TRRT generated about the same amount of states while SPARS2 had a
considerable smaller amount of states. This is because SPARS2 expands from
random points that are evenly distributed over the domain, while the other
planners does a variant of depth search starting from the initial position.
