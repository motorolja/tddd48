2.1:

Run the problems you have created through the same (modern) planners as before, 
and possibly a few additional planners. 

What plans are generated? 

Do they use the carriers?

Does this differ among different planners? 

Discuss your findings briefly in your report for lab 2. 


2.2:

What plans are generated? Do they seem better than before? Do helicopters use
carriers in those cases where this is better according to the distances (which
may not always be the case, if destinations are widely dispersed)? Discuss this
briefly in your report.

When using YASHP3 the planner does not care about optimizing depending on
total-cost and instead tries to return a plan with a minimum amount of actions.  

2.3:

For the modeling part of the lab, try some of these planners on your domain and
problems. Do they handle all PDDL constructs that you have used? If not, you
need to simplify your domain to work with plain STRIPS functionality. Various
simplifications were discussed during one of the lectures. Ask your lab
assistant if you encounter problems!


Test the performance of these planners on your domain and problems, in terms of
speed and quality. Are the plans better, and if so, how much better? Does it
take more time? Do you think it is worth it for this domain? Discuss this
briefly in your report.
