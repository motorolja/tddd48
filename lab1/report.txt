1.1
Run two small problem with ff, how long does it take?

(1 person, 1 crate)   = 0.008 seconds
Plan:
step    0: PICK UAV1 MED_CRATE1 DEPOT
        1: MOVE UAV1 DEPOT LOC1
        2: DELIVER UAV1 MED_CRATE1 MEDICINE P1 LOC1
 

(2 persons, 3 crates) = 0.011 second
Plan:
step    0: PICK UAV1 MED_CRATE2 DEPOT
        1: MOVE UAV1 DEPOT LOC4
        2: DELIVER UAV1 MED_CRATE2 MEDICINE P1 LOC4
        3: MOVE UAV1 LOC4 DEPOT
        4: PICK UAV1 MED_CRATE1 DEPOT
        5: MOVE UAV1 DEPOT LOC3
        6: DELIVER UAV1 MED_CRATE1 MEDICINE P2 LOC3
        7: MOVE UAV1 LOC3 DEPOT
        8: PICK UAV1 FOOD_CRATE1 DEPOT
        9: MOVE UAV1 DEPOT LOC3
       10: DELIVER UAV1 FOOD_CRATE1 FOOD P2 LOC3

1.2
Run the previous two problems in 1.1 through ipp, how long does this take?

(1 person, 1 crate)  = 0.010 seconds
(2 persons, 3 crates)  = 0.016 seconds

How large problems can IPP solve within a one-minute time limit? 

uav=1, carriers=0, locations=4, people=5, crates=10, goals=10

What happens when you (using IPP) increase the number of crates that are not necessary
for the problem? 

The search space is increased and thus the search takes slightly longer to
complete. The increase in execution time is small and nearly neglectable.

What happens when you (using IPP) increase the number of people that need crates? 

The search space is increased and thus the search takes longer to
complete. The increase in execution time is big.

1.3
Selected planners (from 2014):
         yahsp3 
         bifd 
         bfs-f

Run the largest problem generated before through the selected planners, how long until the
first solution is generated?
Had much larger problems but they required to much RAM (>64 GB) and thus got killed since we used to
much resources.

u=UAVs,r=Carriers,l=Locations,p=Persons,c=Crates,g=Goals,con=Number of content types
uav_problem_u1_r0_l6_p8_c20_g14_con2

yahsp3: 0.013 seconds 
bifd:   0.4   seconds
bfs-f:  60+   seconds

How large problems can the selected planners handle with a 1 minute time limit?

u=UAVs,r=Carriers,l=Locations,p=Persons,c=Crates,g=Goals,con=Number of content types

yahsp3: uav_problem_u1_r0_l4_p3_c60_g3_con2    57.67 seconds
bifd:   uav_problem_u1_r0_l4_p3_c30_g3_con2    27.85 seconds
bfs-f:  uav_problem_u1_r0_l4_p30_c6_g3_con2    56.46 seconds
