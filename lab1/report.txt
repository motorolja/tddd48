1.1
Run two small problem with ff, how long does it take?

(1 person, 1 crate)   = 0.008 seconds
Plan:
step    0: PICK UAV1 MED_CRATE1 DEPOT
        1: MOVE UAV1 DEPOT LOC1
        2: DELIVER UAV1 MED_CRATE1 MEDICINE P1 LOC1
 

(2 persons, 3 crates) = 0.011 seconds
Plan:
step    0: PICK UAV1 MED_CRATE2 DEPOT
        1: MOVE UAV1 DEPOT LOC4
        2: DELIVER UAV1 MED_CRATE2 MEDICINE P1 LOC4
        3: MOVE UAV1 LOC4 DEPOT
        4: PICK UAV1 MED_CRATE1 DEPOT
        5: MOVE UAV1 DEPOT LOC3
        6: DELIVER UAV1 MED_CRATE1 MEDICINE P2 LOC3
        7: MOVE UAV1 LOC3 DEPOT
        8: PICK UAV1 FOOD_CRATE1 DEPOT
        9: MOVE UAV1 DEPOT LOC3
       10: DELIVER UAV1 FOOD_CRATE1 FOOD P2 LOC3

1.2
Run the previous two problems in 1.1 through ipp, how long does this take?

(1 person, 1 crate)  = 0.010 seconds
(2 persons, 3 crates)  = 0.016 seconds

How large problems can IPP solve within a one-minute time limit? 

uav=1, carriers=0, locations=4, people=5, crates=10, goals=10

What happens when you increase the number of crates that are not necessary
for the problem? 

The search space is increased and thus the search takes longer to
complete.

What happens when you increase the number of people that need crates?
